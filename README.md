# IEEE-PHM-2012-Prognostic-Challenge
This repository contains the dataset from the PHM IEEE 2012 Data Challenge, previously hosted on the FEMTO-ST website but no longer available online. It includes vibration data from six training bearings under three operating conditions and eleven test bearings. Additional details are provided in the included PDF.


This repository includes the dataset originally used in the PHM IEEE 2012 Data Challenge. Although the dataset was once hosted at the FEMTO-ST Institute website, it is no longer available online.

The data consist of training recordings from six rolling bearings operating under three different conditions, along with a test set of eleven additional bearings. Full details about the challenge, operating conditions, and experimental setup are provided in the included PDF documentation.
